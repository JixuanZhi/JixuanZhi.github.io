**Title:** Improving Human-Robot Collaboration via Computational Design

**2. Abstract**  
We propose a computational framework to optimize shared spaces (e.g., kitchens) for human-robot collaboration. By integrating layout design with decentralized multi-agent motion planning, our method reduces task completion time by 20% and minimizes path conflicts. Evaluations show optimized layouts improve efficiency in diverse environments, including compact and L-shaped kitchens.  

**3. Layman’s Summary**  
Imagine redesigning your kitchen so humans and robots cook together seamlessly. Our AI acts like a teamwork architect: it arranges counters and appliances to reduce collisions and waiting time. Think of it as ‘Tetris for collaboration’—every piece (human, robot, counter) fits perfectly to boost productivity!
