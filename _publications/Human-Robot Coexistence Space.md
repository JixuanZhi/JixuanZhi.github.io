**2. Abstract**  
We propose a computational framework to optimize room layouts for human-robot coexistence, balancing human preferences and robot navigation constraints (e.g., nonholonomic wheelchair motion). Our motion planner reduces design computation time by 65–70%, enabling real-time generation of accessible layouts for bedrooms, offices, and complex L-shaped rooms.

**3. Layman’s Summary**  
Imagine redesigning your living room so both humans and robots move comfortably. Our AI acts like an interior designer for shared spaces: it arranges furniture to match your preferences while ensuring wheelchair robots can navigate efficiently. Think of it as ‘feng shui’ for human-robot harmony!

**4. Key Visuals**  
+ **Figures to Highlight:**  
  + Figure 1: Comparison of bad vs. optimized layouts for wheelchair accessibility.
  + Figure 2: Framework overview (optimization loop with motion planning).
  + Figures 8–11: Optimized designs for bedrooms, offices, and L-shaped rooms.
  + Figure 7: Motion planning time reduction (baseline vs. proposed method).

+ **Infographics:**  
  + Workflow: Human preferences + robot constraints → layout optimization → accessibility paths.  
  + RS-decomposition for nonholonomic motion planning.

**5. Significance & Impact**  
+ **Key Contributions:**
  + First framework to co-optimize human preferences and robot navigation in shared spaces.
  + Ultra-fast motion planner: Reduces computation time from 10–20 minutes to 3–5 minutes.
  + Demonstrated in diverse environments (bedrooms, L-shaped rooms, offices).
+ **Applications:** Accessible home design, smart offices, rehabilitation centers.
