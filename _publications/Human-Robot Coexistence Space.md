Overview

When human-robot interactions become ubiquitous, the environment surrounding these interactions will have a significant impact on the safety and comfort of the human and the effectiveness and efficiency of the robot. This work uses an autonomous wheelchair as an example and investigates the computational design in the human-robot coexistence spaces.

We formulate the design problem as an optimization problem subject to constraints from both human preferences encoded in an action-object relation graph and motion limitations of the robot (e.g., nonholonomic constraint). The key enabling technology is a motion planner that can efficiently evaluate hundreds of similar motion planning problems.
